Similar to but different from Tamagotchi - a grad school project

# set up
## hardware
 - One Waveshare 1.44inch LCD Display Module for Raspberry Pi Pico 65K RGB Colors 128Ã—128 Pixels (we got ours for [$15.99 on Amazon with one-day shipping](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0957NJP97/))
 - One Pre-Soldered Header Raspberry Pi Pico W, Built-in WiFi Support 2.4 GHZ Wi-Fi 4, (we got ours for [$14.60 on Amazon with one-day shipping](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BK9W4H2Q/)
 - One USB-C to MicroUSB cable

## software
 - CircuitPython (9.x)

# to update
 - Our device is optimized for BMP images that are 128x128 pixels and are index to be black and white
 - For some versions of our prototype, we had to convert from JPG to BMP and we used [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-your-first-tilemap-game-with-circuitpython/indexed-bmp-graphics)

# special thanks to free online tutorials
